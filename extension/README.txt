Building the Firefox OpenCL Interface Extension
=================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you can start, you need to download the Gecko SDK. The latest version can
be found at

https://developer.mozilla.org/en/gecko_sdk

Download the archive for your OS and extract at least the bin, lib, idl, sdk
and include directories to the gecko-sdk directory. For MacOS and Linux, you 
need to download the 64 bit version. 32 bit Linux is not supported.

If you want your build to include support for 32 bit mode on 64 Bit MacOS,
create a new directory named gecko-sdk-32. Download and extract the 32 bit 
version of the Gecko SDK as described above into that newly created directory. 
The build process will automatically pick up the 32 bit dependencies and 
create a corresponding version of the extension.

OpenCL Stack
------------

MacOS X 10.6 and later already provide the required OpenCL stack as part of the 
operating system. On Windows and Linux, you will need to install Intel OpenCL 
SDK available at

http://www.intel.com/go/opencl

Building the extension - MacOS
------------------------------

Open a terminal and navigate to the extension subdirectory. Execute the 
following commands:

make -f Makefile.MacOS
make -f Makefile.MacOS deploy

This will build the C++ part of the extension and populate the xpi-contents 
directory.

Building the extension - Linux
------------------------------

Open a terminal and navigate to the extension subdirectory. Execute the 
following commands:

make -f Makefile.Linux
make -f Makefile.Linux deploy

This will build the C++ part of the extension and populate the xpi-contents 
directory.

Building the extension - Windows
--------------------------------

You will need at least Visual C++ Express 2010 and the mozilla build
environment available from

http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe

Install the build environment to the default directory. Open the project file 
found in the extension directory. From the menu select Build->Build solution 
or press F7. This will build the C++ part of the extension and populate the 
xpi-contents directory.

Creating the XPI file
---------------------

To create an XPI file, which can be directly installed as an extension in
Firefox, add the contents of the xpi-contents directory to a new zip archive.
Next, change the extension of the newly created file from zip to xpi.

On MacOS and Linux, you can accomplish this automatically by running

make -f Makefile.MacOS xpi

or

make -f Makefile.Linux xpi

from the extension subdirectory, respectively.  The resulting .xpi
file can be directly installed in Firefox.  Further details on
extension packaging can be found at
