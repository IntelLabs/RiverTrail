River Trail
===========

River Trail is a JavaScript library and a Firefox add-on that together provide support for **data-parallel programming in JavaScript**, targeting multi-core CPUs, GPUs and vector SSE/AVX instructions.

Please see the [project wiki](https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/wiki) or the [FAQs](https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for more details.

## Quick Start

  1. Install [OpenCL](http://www.intel.com/go/opencl).  (Mac OS X users can skip this step, since OpenCL is already part of the system.)
  2. Install or open [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
  3. Install the [River Trail Firefox add-on](https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/releases/).
  4. Using Firefox with the River Trail add-on enabled, try one of our [live demos](https://github.com/IntelLabs/RiverTrail/wiki#sample-applications), or the [interactive shell](http://intellabs.github.io/RiverTrail-interactive/)!
  5. A good way to get started with programming with the River Trail API is to go through our [tutorial](http://intellabs.github.io/RiverTrail/tutorial/).
